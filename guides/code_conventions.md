# Code Conventions

 * Each project should ship with an [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). You are expected to use an editor which honors this.
 * Each project should note any special setup requirements within it's own README.md file.
 * Please try and avoid checking in commented out code. Things can always be recovered through version control.
 * Please try and work on branches and merge into development/master.
 * Please try and use the date format YYYY-MM-DD for any file names to avoid confusion.
 * Please focus on readability. If it's slow then we refactor. If it's unavoidable then we comment profusely.
 * TODOs are unavoidable. But if you come across one and it's covered by a unit test, and you have time, then look at resolving.
